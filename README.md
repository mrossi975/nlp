# Natural language data extraction with Apache OpenNLP 

This is simple Java 17 experimental application to extract the important data points from a restaurant reservation.
Currently only English is supported but the solution could be easily extended to support other languages.
This is not meant as production code but rather as an example which may help you if you are looking to implement your own solution based on Apache OpenNLP.
